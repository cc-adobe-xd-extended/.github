# Adobe XD
Adobe XD (Experience Design) stands as Adobe's premier solution for crafting user interfaces and digital experiences. This all-in-one platform empowers designers to develop wireframes, interactive prototypes, and polished designs for both websites and mobile applications. Being part of the Creative Cloud ecosystem, it works flawlessly with other Adobe software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, speeding up the design journey from concept to completion. Thanks to its modern and intuitive interface, XD has become the top choice for designers and developers aiming to create and work together on projects efficiently.

## **What Adobe XD Is Used For**

Adobe XD is the industry-leading tool for UI/UX design experts. As a vector-based application, it is widely employed in designing websites, wireframes, and mobile app interfaces. Like other tools such as inVision Studio, XD offers strong features for linking screens and building interactive prototypes without any coding. Coupled with its smooth integration into the Adobe environment, these attributes make it a strong competitor against other well-known platforms like Sketch and Figma.


## **Main Features**

- **Vector Design Tools**: Design and edit vector graphics within the app itself
- **Interactive Prototyping**: Create working prototypes with seamless transitions and user interactions
- **Artboard Management**: Work with and animate multiple artboards in a single file
- **Repeat Grid**: Quickly duplicate items such as lists and grids
- **Responsive Resizing**: Adjust layouts intelligently for different screen sizes
- **Plugin Support**: Expand features using third-party add-ons
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive Adobe-style layout with tools on the left and design elements on the right

## **Starting Your Project**

Launch your design by creating artboards, each representing a screen in your prototype. Select from standard device sizes or set your own custom measurements. XD makes it simple to move elements between artboards using drag-and-drop, and allows handling multiple artboards at once for quicker edits. The application includes two grid types:

- **Layout Grids**: Create columns for responsive design needs
- **Square Grids**: Achieve exact alignment for text and objects

XD operates in two main modes:
- **Design Mode**: Perfect for creating visuals, wireframes, and mockups
- **Prototype Mode**: Ideal for adding interactions and testing user flows

Together, these functionalities make Adobe XD a powerful tool for modern, responsive design and effective team collaboration.
